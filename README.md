# FA25-Motive


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/csu-hci-projects/FA25-Motive.git
cd FA25-Motive

### 2. Open in Unity Hub
- Open Unity Hub
- Make sure you use **Unity 6.2 (6000.2.2f1)**.

### 3. Unity settings
- Asset serialization: **Force Text** (already set in project settings).
- Meta files: Unity 6.x generates them automatically â€” do **not** delete `.meta` files.
- Do not commit `Library/`, `Temp/`, or `Builds/` (these are already ignored in `.gitignore`).

##  Third-Party Asset: Vintage Living Room Pack

We don't want to commit this commercial pack into GitHub.  
Each team member will need to import it locally:

1. In Unity: **Window â†’ Package Manager**  
2. Switch to **My Assets**  
3. Find **Vintage Living Room 3D Game Pack**  
4. **Download** (if needed) â†’ **Import**

If you see missing meshes or pink materials, make sure youâ€™ve imported this pack.  
(URP users may need to run **Edit â†’ Rendering â†’ Materials â†’ Convert to URP**.)

## ðŸ”€ Git Workflow

- **avoid** commiting large generated files. `.gitignore` already excludes them.  
- **Do commit** your scenes, scripts, prefabs, and `.meta` files.  
- The third-party asset folder (`Assets/VintageLivingRoom3D/`) is ignored â€” teammates import it themselves.

### Daily workflow
```bash
git pull         # get the latest changes
# work in Unity
git add -A       # stage changes
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
git push         # send to GitHub
```

### Conflict avoidance
- Prefer creating new scenes or nested prefabs rather than all editing the same scene.  
- If two people must touch the same scene, coordinate and merge carefully.

## For Grading

- Unity version: **6.2 (6000.2.2f1)**  
- Open the project in Unity Hub after cloning.  
- If you want to view the optional **Vintage Living Room 3D Game Pack**, you will need to import it from Unityâ€™s Asset Store (we cannot redistribute it in the repo).  
- Without the pack, the project will still compile, but certain props/environments will appear missing.
